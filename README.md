# Julius' Development Environment

## Features
- CentOS based
- fish + omf
- awscli
- git
- nvm
- java


## Assumptions
- put your projects in the `apps` directory
- because node versions vary per project, it's better to nvm install manually
- uses a netrc file for storing git repo credentials
- secrets are kept in `keys.yml` files
- `firewalld` is disabled by default
